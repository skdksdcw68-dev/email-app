import SwiftUI
import UIKit

/// Pins a SwiftUI bar to the top of the system keyboard, from UIKit.
///
/// The bar's vertical position is computed from the keyboard's own frame, in
/// window coordinates, every time the keyboard says it is about to move, and
/// applied inside the keyboard's own animation curve and duration. Nothing
/// about SwiftUI's layout, safe area or keyboard avoidance is involved in
/// where the bar goes, which is the point: every version that leaned on any
/// of those either jumped or ended up behind the keyboard.
///
/// What was tried and why it is not here:
///
/// - `safeAreaInset`: the keyboard changed the safe area, the ScrollView
///   relaid out, SwiftUI recomputed the composer, and only then did it move.
///   Measured drifting 8pt to 40pt from the keyboard mid-dismissal.
/// - `UIKeyboardLayoutGuide`: the right idea, and on this device inside a
///   SwiftUI-hosted controller it did not track. Screenshots with the
///   keyboard up showed no bar at all -- it was sitting at the bottom of the
///   screen, under the keyboard, exactly where a guide that never moved
///   would leave it.
///
/// Rules that still hold:
///
/// 1. The host is exactly as tall as the bar and only its bottom is
///    positioned, so the keyboard moves the host rather than resizing it.
///    Resizing a UIKit host with SwiftUI content inside makes the content
///    snap to the final layout while the container animates.
///
/// 2. The host's height comes from SwiftUI's own measurement of the bar at
///    its real width. Intrinsic content size measures at an unconstrained
///    width, where a vertical text field is always one line.
///
/// 3. The hosted view is rebuilt only when `inputs` change, not on every
///    streamed token.
///
/// Two measurements come back out: `height`, the bar's own height, so the
/// content behind it can leave room; and `bottom`, how much of the screen
/// the bar and the keyboard together take from the bottom.
